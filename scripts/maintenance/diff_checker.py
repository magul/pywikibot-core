"""Check that the latest commit diff follows the guidelines.

Currently the script only checks line lengths. Lines longer than 79 characters
should be avoided.
See [[Manual:Pywikibot/Development/Guidelines]] for more info.

Todo: The following rules can be added in the future:
    - For any changes or new lines use single quotes for strings, or double
        quotes  if the string contains a single quote. But keep older code
        unchanged.
    - Do not use a u'' prefix on strings, as it is meaningless due to
        __future__.unicode_literals. But keep older code unchanged.
