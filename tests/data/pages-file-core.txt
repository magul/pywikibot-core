XXXXXX Good
This is a file for the core mode (the compat mode may still work with it, but
that is not important). It supports differentiating separators so that it's
possible to write the file without knowing the content of all pages.

So it's writing here with 6 Xes but it doesn't know if the following pages
contain this text.
XXXXXXYYYYYY Bad
Okay here we go. It contains XXXXXX and it would stop there. But that is not
good so it redefined the separator to 6 Ys.
YYYYYY Good again
Another good file. Only XXXXXX here but not YYYYY- HA tricked you ;)
YYYYYYZZZ Changed length
What if the marker changed length, does it still work? A change is not necessary
here but the reader does not care.
ZZZZZ Changed length but same chars
Okay this is tricky. Did you see that three Z changed into two Z now? This is
posssible too.
ZZ
