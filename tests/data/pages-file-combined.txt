This is the content of '''Page''' 1.
XXXXXX
This format is fun. Why? Because you can write your own stories in between the
pages. Or jokes..., but I can't think of any yet.

But seriously! This is a test, so '''pretend''' we are a page!
XXXXXX
Anyway '''Other''' page is now here.
XXXXXX
Before I copy jokes from Google results I recommend to you the '''XKCD'''
comics. One of my favourites is probably http://xkcd.com/612/ but there are a
lot more which are good.
XXXXXX Fifth
So lets have a '''third''' page here.
XXXXXX
Oh maybe I should '''note''' a bit about this file. It should be readable by
both modes. The compat mode should only read half as many as the core mode. The
content for them is mostly irrelevant except for the page above this one. The
text may NOT contain Fifth itself. Otherwise the content is not important as
long as the title does not change.

Happy testing!
